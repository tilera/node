You simply provide them a name that can be wildcard matched in a similar way to [eve](/DmitryBaranovskiy/eve) and retrieved later.  Using this technique you can either specifically target a particular thing by using a specific name or a more generalized instance using a more generalized namespace.\n\nPrimarily, Registry has been designed for use in the browser but will also work quite happily in a CommonJS environment (such as Node).\n\n## Example Usage\n\nAt the moment, the tests contain some of the best examples of how Registry can be used, but full documentation will be completed one day...",
